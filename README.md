DriverPass Project Summary

The DriverPass project was focused on designing a system for a company that helps people pass their driving tests by offering online classes, practice tests, and in-car driving lessons. The client was DriverPass, and they wanted a more efficient, user-friendly system to help manage class registration, scheduling in-car training, and tracking student progress.

One thing I did particularly well was creating clear use case diagrams that showed how users interact with the system. This helped break down complex tasks into understandable steps and made it easier to communicate the system’s functionality.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the technical requirements section. I’d make it more detailed by including specific tools, software platforms, and infrastructure needs like cloud storage and mobile device compatibility. This would give a clearer picture of what the system needs to run effectively.

To understand the user’s needs, I looked closely at the interview transcript and identified what features students, instructors, and administrators needed. Then, I made sure those features were reflected in the design diagrams and system functions. Considering the user’s needs is important because if the system doesn’t solve their real problems or is hard to use, it won’t be successful—even if it works technically.

When I design software, I start by gathering user requirements and turning them into use cases. Then, I create diagrams like activity and sequence charts to map out the flow. In the future, I plan to focus more on early feedback from users and use strategies like prototyping and iterative design. This way, I can make sure the system actually works well for the people who will use it.
